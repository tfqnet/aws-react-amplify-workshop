# A React Webapp with AWS Amplify

This is a self-paced workshop designed for developers who want to build a React Web application using [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/) from [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## Reference Architecture

This is a sample web application to allow users to create blog posts on the website. My web application is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and I will also be using [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/index.html) to quickly bootstrap the whole application. AWS Amplify provides a declarative and make it really easy to add features like authentication and analytics to our mobile application. Our backend will be powered by [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/), a fully managed GraphQL service. AWS AppSync defines a GraphQL Schema with data types and GraphQL operations (query, mutation and subscription). It also associate a set of resolvers to Amazon DynamoDB, where we have 1 dynamoDB table for our data model.
